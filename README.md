# What is Maplestory Scrolling?

Scrolling in Maplestory is a means to increase the stats of the equipment.  
Each scroll has a certain success chain accompanied by a set of stats it can give on a successful upgrade.  
The lower the chance of the scroll to succeed, the higher the stats it will give.  
Every item has a certain amount of times it can be upgraded, called slots.  
When an item's slot reaches 0, the equipment can no longer be upgraded.  

There are many different of stats to upgrade on an equipment.  
- Weapon Attack
- Magic Attack
- STR (Strength)
- DEX (Dexterity)
- INT (Intelligence)
- LUK (Luck)
- Defence
- Magic Defence
- And much more!

# Different Scroll Types 

Chaos Scrolls are a unique type of scroll that has a 60% chance of success, and can alter an existing stat by a range of -5 to 5.  
Chaos Scrolls are extremely risky as a successful upgrade can lower an equipment's stats still, but can also offer great benefits.  

White Scrolls are a unique scroll not meant to be used on a item, but rather accompanies other scrolls.  
White Scrolls are activated when a scroll fails, it will spare the slot from being consumed.  

Dark Scroll appear in the 30% and 70% form, while giving an increased chance of success to their counterparts 10% and 60% scrolls have a chance to destroy the item upon failing at a 50% chance.  

Auf Haven scrolls are a unique set of scrolls specific to the Auf Haven Circlet.  
All Auf Haven scrolls have a 50% chance of success.  
However, the dark scrolls have a chance to destroy the item when failing while giving +3 to the chosen stat.
The white scrolls do not have a chance to destroy the item when failining while only giving + 2 to the chose stat.
